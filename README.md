#This is small and simple html and css based mini hackathon quiz it also has a countdown 

you can start quiz from first page to move forward<br>
Although there are many issues with it as if you reload page during puzzle you will end up on first lvl because of tokens used but it is still helpful since you can't enter final lvl directly.
